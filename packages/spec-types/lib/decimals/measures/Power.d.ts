/** Power (Watt as Unit of Power): In the context of power, the watt measures the rate at which energy is transferred or converted. It represents the amount of energy consumed or produced per unit of time. Power is the rate of doing work or the rate of energy transfer.
  
  For example, when you see a light bulb labeled as "60 watts," it's indicating the power consumption of the bulb, which tells you how much energy it uses per unit of time. */
